## What is RabbitMQ?

RabbitMQ is a **message broker** that enables applications to communicate with each other asynchronously. It implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and provides a reliable way for different parts of an application to exchange messages without tight coupling.

### Key Benefits

- **Decoupling**: Producers and consumers work independently
- **Reliability**: Messages can persist, retry, and acknowledge delivery
- **Scalability**: Distribute work across multiple consumers
- **Flexibility**: Multiple messaging patterns and exchange types

---

## What are RabbitMQ Exchanges?

Exchanges are **message routing agents** that receive messages from producers and route them to queues based on rules called **bindings**. Think of an exchange as a postal sorting office — it decides where each message should go based on its routing rules.

### Exchange Anatomy

## Exchange Types Covered

This repository demonstrates all four standard RabbitMQ exchange types:

| Exchange Type | Routing Strategy | Best Use Case |
|--------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Direct** | Exact routing key match | Simple point-to-point routing |
| **Topic** | Wildcard pattern matching | Category-based routing |
| **Fanout** | Broadcast to all queues | Pub/Sub broadcasting |
| **Headers** | Multiple attribute matching | Complex attribute-based routing |

---

## Exchange Types Explained

### 1. Direct Exchange

**Routing based on exact routing key matching**

The simplest exchange type that routes messages to queues based on an **exact match** between the message's routing key and the binding key.

```javascript
// Publisher
channel.publish(exchange, "order.placed", message)

// Consumer binding
channel.bindQueue(queue, exchange, "order.placed")
```

**Use Cases:**
- Task queues for specific workers
- User-type routing (free/premium)
- Priority-based message routing
- Region-specific routing

**[Learn More →](direct-exchange/README.md)**

---

### 2. Topic Exchange

**Routing based on wildcard pattern matching**

Routes messages using **wildcard patterns** (`*` for one word, `#` for zero or more words) in dot-separated routing keys.

```javascript
// Publisher
channel.publish(exchange, "order.shipped", message)

// Consumer binding - receives all order messages
channel.bindQueue(queue, exchange, "order.#")
```

**Use Cases:**
- Microservices event routing
- Log aggregation by severity and source
- Notification systems with categories
- IoT device message routing

**[Learn More →](topic-exchange/README.md)**

---

### 3. Fanout Exchange

**Broadcasts messages to all bound queues**

Routes messages to **all queues** bound to the exchange, ignoring routing keys entirely.

```javascript
// Publisher - routing key is ignored
channel.publish(exchange, "", message)

// All bound queues receive the message
channel.bindQueue(queue1, exchange, "")
channel.bindQueue(queue2, exchange, "")
channel.bindQueue(queue3, exchange, "")
```

**Use Cases:**
- Push notifications to multiple channels
- Event broadcasting to multiple services
- Live score updates
- Chat message delivery

**[Learn More →](fanout-exchange/README.md)**

---

### 4. Headers Exchange

**Routing based on message header attributes**

Routes messages based on **multiple header attributes** with `x-match: all` (AND) or `x-match: any` (OR) logic.

```javascript
// Publisher with headers
channel.publish(exchange, "", message, {
    headers: {
        "content-type": "video",
        "priority": "high"
    }
})

// Consumer binding
channel.bindQueue(queue, exchange, "", {
    "x-match": "all",
    "content-type": "video",
    "priority": "high"
})
```

**Use Cases:**
- Complex attribute-based routing
- Multi-criteria filtering
- Content-type and format filtering
- Priority and tier-based routing

**[Learn More →](header-exchange/README.md)**

---

## Running the Demos

Each exchange type has its own folder with a detailed README and runnable examples.

### Step 1: Start RabbitMQ

```bash
docker run --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 -d rabbitmq:management
```

### Step 2: Choose an Exchange Type

```bash
# Option 1: Direct Exchange
cd direct-exchange
# Run producer in one terminal
node producer.js
# Run consumers in other terminals
node normalConsumer.js
node subConsumer.js

# Option 2: Topic Exchange
cd topic-exchange
node producer.js
node orderNotificationService.js
node paymentNotificationService.js

# Option 3: Fanout Exchange
cd fanout-exchange
node producer.js
node pushNotification.js
node smsNotification.js

# Option 4: Headers Exchange
cd header-exchange
node producer.js
node newVideoNotifications.js
node liveStreamNotifications.js
node commentsLikeNotifications.js
```

### Step 3: View Results

Check the consumer terminals to see messages being received based on the exchange type's routing logic.

### Step 4: Monitor with Management UI

Open **http://localhost:15672** in your browser to:
- View queues and exchanges
- Monitor message rates
- Check bindings and connections
- Manage exchanges and queues

## Best Practices

### 1. Exchange Configuration

```javascript
// Always use durable exchanges for production
await channel.assertExchange(exchange, type, { durable: true })

// Use auto-delete for temporary exchanges
await channel.assertExchange(exchange, type, { autoDelete: true })
```

### 2. Queue Configuration

```javascript
// Durable queues survive broker restart
await channel.assertQueue(queueName, { durable: true })

// Exclusive queues are auto-deleted when connection closes
await channel.assertQueue("", { exclusive: true })
```

### 3. Message Acknowledgment

```javascript
// Manual acknowledgment (recommended)
channel.consume(queue, (msg) => {
    if (msg) {
        // Process message
        channel.ack(msg)
    }
})
```

### 4. Error Handling

```javascript
try {
    // RabbitMQ operations
} catch (error) {
    console.error('RabbitMQ Error:', error)
    // Implement retry logic
}
```

## Exchange Type Selection Guide

```
Need exact routing?                    → Use DIRECT
Need pattern matching?                 → Use TOPIC
Need broadcast to all?                 → Use FANOUT
Need header-based routing?             → Use HEADERS
```

```

## Common Errors & Solutions

### Connection Refused

```bash
# Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5672

# Solution: Ensure RabbitMQ is running
docker ps
docker start rabbitmq  # if stopped
```

### Queue Not Found

```javascript
// Error: NOT_FOUND - no queue 'queue_name'

// Solution: Declare queue before consuming
await channel.assertQueue(queueName, { durable: false })
```

### Message Not Delivered

- Check exchange and queue bindings
- Verify routing key matches exactly
- Ensure consumer is running before producer
- Check message acknowledgment
